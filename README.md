I'm fascinated by how technology can understand and simplify our lives. This interest took me from a background in software development to a deep dive into AI and Machine Learning. For me, it's not just about writing code; it's about creating systems that feel natural, whether it's an AI giving career advice or a smart home that reacts to your voice. I enjoy the process of transforming a complex technical problem into a simple, elegant solution that makes a real difference.

  <summary>ðŸ“– The Story So Far</summary><br>
  <ul>
    <li>My journey into technology started with a strong foundation in software principles through a Diploma in Computer Engineering. I developed my skills in Java, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented Programming.         This sparked my interest in creating strong applications and drove me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.</li><br>
    <li>This focus allowed me to explore machine learning, deep learning, and cloud computing in depth. To enhance my academic experience, I looked for hands-on opportunities through various internships. I began with web development and cloud infrastructure, which helped me understand the entire technology stack. My key experience was an AI internship at the Edunet Foundation, where I transitioned from theory to practice. There, I implemented ML models, worked with NLP techniques, and developed deep learning frameworks.</li><br>
    <li>My passion for AI shines through in my projects. While I've built full-stack applications like "Room Loop" to improve my software engineering skills, my main focus has been on creating intelligent systems. I developed "mycareer.ai," an AI-driven career counselling platform that uses NLP for personalised recommendations. Additionally, I made "Puch home," which allows smart home control using natural language commands. These projects illustrate my main interest: building practical, complete AI solutions that address real-world challenges. I am now excited to apply my blend of software engineering skills and specialised AI knowledge in a challenging role as an AI Engineer.</li>
